## My process

  

### Built with

  

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

  

### What I learned

  

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

  

```html

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

```

```css

.proud-of-this-css {

color: papayawhip;

}

```

```js

const  proudOfThisFunc = () => {

console.log('ðŸŽ‰')

}

```

  

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

  

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

  

### Continued development

  

I would like to implement this project using ReactJS, Sass.
In another iteration, I would like to explore how to vertically position the qr code to the center especially when the bottom tab exists 


  

### Useful resources

  

- [New Viewport Units](https://ishadeed.com/article/new-viewport-units/#:~:text=Be%20careful%20with%20the%20dvh,is%20scrolling%20up%20or%20down.) - This can potentially help me in centering the screen in mobile that have tabs (as mentioned above).

## Acknowledgments

  
I want to thank Grace Snow for helping me solve an issue where the css file was not loading in Safari but worked in other browsers like Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge. It was because I had left the value empty for link tag's type attribute.
